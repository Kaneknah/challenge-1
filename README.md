This project was a challenge to restructure CSS and HTML on a visualy satisfatory but poorly writen application. This project was created to gain experience in streamlining concepts such as <Class> vs. <ID> use, Semantic Tag Elements, duplicated CSS atributes and Universal Access. The following issues were resovled in this process
-Changed <Div> elements int Semantic Elements with more presice naming in HTML and thier corisponding CSS partners
-Added a Title in the <Head> section
-Changed different <ID>'s to Classes to limit the imput of different CSS atributes
-Fixed missing <ID> link in Navigation bar.
-Added aternatives for images to allow for universal access.
